      <h1>About Cellbytes</h1>
      <p>
        Cellbytes® began from frustration. Having spent years navigating the
        complexities of hematology and machine intelligence, we saw a critical
        gap: while medical technology was leaping forward, the tools used to
        diagnose complex blood disorders hadn't kept pace. We realized that by
        combining the expertise of laboratory physicians with the power of
        computer vision, we could build something transformative.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're a team of physicians and engineers who speak both "lab" and
        "code". In a clinical setting, every cell tells a story and every second
        counts. We're here to help you focus on interpretation, not manual
        overhead.
      </p>

      <H level="2">Our Promise</H>
      <p>
        We're humans, not a faceless corporation. If a feature isn't intuitive
        or a tool isn't performing exactly how you need it to, we take it
        personally. Our priority isn't just closing a ticket, but making sure
        your workflow is seamless. If it's broken, we fix it. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that high-quality blood and bone marrow analysis shouldn't be
        a luxury or a bottleneck. By making cytomorphology more accessible and
        efficient, we're helping physicians and researchers get the answers they
        need faster. At the end of the day, we're not just analyzing cells but
        helping people get back to their lives.
