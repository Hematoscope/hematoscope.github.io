      <h1>Innovation powered by research</h1>
      <p>
        At Cellbytes, our mission is to provide the ultimate AI companion for
        your diagnostic needs. Cellbytes is the first medical device to deliver
        a comprehensive cytomorphological assessment, including whole-slide
        analysis, cell classification, and dysplasia detection. Every algorithm
        is built on cutting-edge research and validated by robust scientific and
        clinical metrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is deeply rooted in academia, constantly advancing the
        frontiers of deep learning and computational hematology. Our research
        explores the intricate connections between cell morphology, disease
        genetics, and clinical outcomes, with the goal of improving the
        understanding and management of blood disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;re eager to collaborate with you on your research goals.
        Cellbytes&apos;s in-house R&D team has developed advanced algorithms for
        investigational use. Let us know how we can support your work and
        contribute to your discoveries.
